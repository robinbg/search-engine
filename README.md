# search-engine
Search engine project written in Python. Uses Cosine Similarity for ranking and Tkinter for GUI. Index limited to my university's computer science subdomains.

Create index by either unzipping zip files into a folder labelled "INDEX", or by running "create_index.py" to create the index, then "recalc_tfidf.py" to calculate tfidf values for ranking.
